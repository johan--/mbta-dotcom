# Typescript

### Notes about setup

If you are using VSCode, you will want to set your workspace preferences to point to the version of Typescript in this project.
At this time, that means adding this to your Workspace Preferences json file (`CMD+P` Workspace settings`):

```
{
  "typescript.tsdk": "./assets/node_modules/typescript/lib"
}
```
